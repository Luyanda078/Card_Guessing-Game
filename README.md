<h1>Node.js Card_Guessing-Game</h1>

<p>This project is a Card Guessing Game built with Node.js, Express, and EJS as the templating engine. The objective of the game is for players to match pairs of cards by flipping two cards at a time. The game is won when all pairs are correctly matched. This project helps in understanding templating engines, serving static assets, and managing dynamic content rendering in a web application.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>6x6 Card Grid Layout: 36 cards (18 matching pairs) arranged in a responsive 6x6 grid.
Card Matching Logic: Players flip two cards; if they match, they remain visible. If not, they flip back.
Game Reset: Players can reset the game, shuffling cards to start fresh.
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>Node.js: Backend server setup and game logic.</p>
<p>Express: Server framework to manage routes and serve content.</p>
<p>EJS: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.</p>
<p>CSS: Styling for game layout, card appearance, and animations.</p>
<p>JavaScript: Client-side code for handling card flips and matching logic.</p>
